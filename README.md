# Dynamic visualisation of covid timeseries

Implemented in Wolfram Mathematica, this interactive graph shows a chosen timeseries data with possibility to zoom in on any section. Also, there is an option to predict upcoming data with AR, MA, ARMA, ARIMA, and SARIMA processes. Data can be also modeled with Exponential smoothing or Kalman filter.
